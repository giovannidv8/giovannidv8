<h3 align="center">💬 About me</h3>

🤝 My name is Giovanni del Vecchio and I live in Milan, Italy. <br>
🎓 I moved here to study at `Politecnico di Milano` where I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Currently I am working on my thesis project that is the last step to take for my MSc graduation in `Computer Science and Engineering`. <br>
👓 My areas of interest reside mainly in `Machine Learning` and `Data Science` topics, but I am always eager to learn new technologies from different fields. <br>
🏉 I love doing sports and I am currently a Rugby player

<h3 align="center"> 📌 Main Projects</h3>

- [Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/AN2DL-2020):<br> 
The project consisted of three subtasks:
1. Image classification: about 95% accuracy reached in classifying images with or without people wearing masks by using a fine tuned CNN and transfer learning from well known ANN architecture.
2. Image segmentation: accomplished to reach a result of more than 0.70 in IoU metric by building a U-Net-like ANN exploiting tiling and image augmentation techniques.
3. Visual Question Answering: about 60% accuracy reached in answering questions related to given images using LSTMs and Co-attention mechanism.<br>
`TensorFlow` `Keras` `NumPy` `Pandas` `NLP`
- [Recommender Systems Project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/RecSys-2020):<br>
Design of a Recommender System for an online book shop combining various kind of systems like: User based, Item based, Matrix Factorization, SLIM, Factorization Machines, Graph based. Exploiting some Bagging and Boosting techniques (like XGBoost) our Recommender System reached a MAP@10 of 0.1015.<br>
`NumPy` `SciPy` `Pandas` `MatPlotLib` `Cython` `Matrix Factorization`
- [Data Intelligence Applications Project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/DataIntelligenceApplications):<br>
Accomplished to yield the optimal combinations of advertising cost per click and pricing strategies in a virtual scenario assessing the goal through CTR and conversion rate metrics, for a discrete set of customers categories, by tuning and combining different online Multi Armed Bandit algorithms such as UCB-like bandits, Thompson sampling bandits and Gaussian Processes bandits.<br>
`Scikit-learn` `MatPlotLib` `NumPy` `MAB` 
- [Software Engineering Project](https://github.com/fcolombo7/ing-sw-2019-craighero-colombo-delvecchio):<br>
Digitalization of a boardgame called Adrenalina in Java language. Implementation through Object Oriented Programming classical patterns like MVC. Design of multiplayer mode using Socket and RMI for client/server communication. Built two different User Interfaces: one implemented with JavaFX and the the other in a CLI style.<br>
`Java` `OOP` `MVC` `client/server` `UI`
